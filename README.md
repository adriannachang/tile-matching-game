Tile Matching Game built in Processing for CS1

Assignment Description:

Create a "memory game (Links to an external site.)": make a 4x3 layout of tiles, each of which conceals a color. The hidden content has 6 distinct types, which come in pairs (there are two tiles of each type).

Clicking on a tile reveals it; clicking on a second tile reveals that one too. Clicking on a third tile reveals it and hides the two previously revealed tiles (that is, only two tiles can be showing at once). Clicking on a currently revealed tile has no effect.

Complete the memory game by having the system track the interaction. When two revealed tiles have the same color, they remain revealed until the game is over, and the player can continue uncovering more tiles. When all tiles are revealed, a message appears stating that the player has won; by clicking, the player can begin a new game with a new random layout.
